# 8-2-Journal-Portfolio-Submission


The Gaming Room client tasked us with creating a web-based puzzle game, aimed at reaching a wide audience. Our role involved conducting a thorough comparison of different operating systems to identify the best fit for the company's goals and user satisfaction. My strongest contribution was in meticulously outlining each operating system's advantages and challenges, especially regarding development costs, which laid a robust groundwork for our final recommendations.

Compiling the design document was a pivotal step that enhanced our grasp of what the client envisioned, enabling a focused and efficient coding phase. Given the chance to refine our work, I would enrich the section on recommendations, delving deeper into the security aspects and inherent capabilities of our preferred operating system to bolster the reasoning behind our choice.

Placing the user's needs at the forefront was a key strategy, as it steered the development process towards producing a product that not only meets but exceeds user expectations. This approach is vital in crafting software that resonates with users. Moving forward, I plan to prioritize a clear comprehension of the project's objectives and a rigorous check on coding details, aiming to minimize errors and fulfill both client and user expectations with a superior software solution.
